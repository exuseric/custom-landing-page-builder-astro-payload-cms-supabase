### **1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

#### **1.1. Introduction & Vision**

This document defines the requirements for the **Landing Page Generator**. The project is a high-performance, scalable system for creating and deploying consistent, on-brand, and SEO-optimized landing pages for multiple clients.

Built on the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework, it leverages static site generation (SSG) for maximum performance, security, and reliability. The system is designed around a library of composable components that can be dynamically populated with data from an external source, allowing for the rapid creation of unique pages without sacrificing brand consistency or quality.

#### **1.2. Goals & Objectives**

*   **Speed of Development:** Radically reduce the time required to build and deploy new client landing pages.
*   **Brand Consistency:** Ensure all generated pages adhere to a consistent, modern, and professional design language defined by a central styling system.
*   **High Performance:** Deliver excellent Core Web Vitals and user experience through statically generated sites, optimized assets, and modern web practices.
*   **Maintainability:** Centralize logic and styling to make updates and bug fixes easy to implement across all generated sites.
*   **Scalability:** Effortlessly support a growing number of client landing pages from a single, unified codebase.

#### **1.3. User Personas**

*   **Developer:** The primary user responsible for creating new components, maintaining the codebase, and extending the system's functionality.
*   **Content Manager / Marketer:** A secondary user who provides the content (text, images, branding) for each landing page, likely via a headless CMS or structured data files that feed into the build process.
*   **End-User:** The visitor of the generated landing page, who expects a fast, responsive, and easy-to-navigate web experience.

#### **1.4. Features & Requirements**

*   **Core Engine:**
    *   **Framework:** Astro for static site generation.
    *   **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
    *   **Multi-Site Generation:** The `build/` directory structure indicates the system compiles individual, domain-specific sites from the shared codebase.

*   **Styling & Theming:**
    *   **Global Design System:** A central `global.css` file establishes a comprehensive design system using CSS variables for typography, colors, spacing, and a responsive grid.
    *   **Themable Colors:** The system uses a `--themeColor` variable that dynamically adjusts the primary, secondary, and tertiary color palettes, allowing for easy client-specific branding.
    *   **Utility Classes:** A rich set of utility classes for text, backgrounds, and layout allows for rapid and consistent styling.

*   **Component Library:** The system is built on a library of reusable Astro components.
    *   **Core Components:** `Container`, `CustomImage`, `GridContainer`, `Head`.
    *   **Navigation:** Multiple navigation styles (`BlockyNav`, `FloatingPill`, `StickyNav`) with shared logic.
    *   **Hero Sections:** A variety of hero layouts to serve different content needs (`AlternateHorizontal`, `BigName`, `Overflow`, etc.).
    *   **Cards:** A flexible set of card components for displaying features, galleries, and information (`Alternating`, `Blocky`, `IconCard`, `InfoCard`).
    *   **Page Sections:** Composable sections for various content types, including `Contact`, `CTA`, `Partners`, `Stats`, and `Testimonials`.
    *   **Footer:** Multiple footer designs (`FloatingFooter`, `TinyFooter`).

*   **Content & Data:**
    *   **Dynamic Data Handling:** The `src/utils/payload/` directory suggests a robust system for fetching and processing data from an external API or headless CMS.
    *   **Content-Driven Pages:** Components are designed to be populated by this external data, separating content from presentation.

*   **Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   **Multi-language Support:** The `src/utils/lang/` directory (with `en.json`, `pt.json`) indicates built-in support for multiple languages.

*   **Performance & Accessibility:**
    *   **Reduced Motion Support:** The CSS includes `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries to disable animations for users who require it.
    *   **Screen Reader Only:** Includes an `.sr-only` class for accessible, screen-reader-only content.
    *   **Semantic HTML:** Components should use semantic HTML5 tags for better accessibility and SEO.
